Pythagoras-Fractal-Tree
=======================

Pythagoras Fractal Tree

Using GLFW, C / C++ MINGW GCC x64.

GLFW is an Open Source, multi-platform library for creating windows
with OpenGL contexts and managing input and events. 
It is easy to integrate into existing applications and does not lay claim to the main loop.

GLFW is written in C and has native support for Windows, 
OS X and many Unix-like systems using the X Window System, such as Linux and FreeBSD.

Mingw-w64 delivers runtime, 
headers and libs for developing both 64 bit (x64) and 32 bit (x86) 
windows applications using GCC and other free software compilers.

* This is x64 Version, 
so Mingw and GLFW files are for x64.
* It can be built for x32 too, - need to change build command line and replace glfw dll lib files.
